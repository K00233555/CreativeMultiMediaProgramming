    <p class ="aboutUsText">Hi. My name is Eugene O' Regan and I am nearing completion of the Higher Diploma in Creative Multimedia Programming as of April 2018.</p>
    <p class ="aboutUsText">While I have a long history of computing, I never really got into the design side of things. So, last Summer, I decided to apply and a year later, I'm here. It's been a roller coaster and this website is a guide to anyone who might be interested in participating in the course in the near future.  </p>
