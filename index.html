    <h1>So what is Creative Multimedia Programming? </h1>
   <p class = "mainArticleParagraph">
   Creative Multimedia Programming is a one year Higher Diploma course offered by the Department of Computing in conjunction with Springboard. Aimed as a conversion course for those unemployed and seeking to enter the IT industry, the course focuses on the creative aspects of design and the practical technicalities of programming. It is an intensive course, with continuous assessment providing the basis of student evaluation. The steep learning curve can seem daunting but 
    </p>
    <h2>What are the main topics covered?</h2>
    <p>The main emphasis of the course is to amalgamate the creative process of design (film and visual representations) and the various technical means of capturing and showcasing this work (web design and database management). Extensive work with a variety of software ensures that not only does the student learn the core concepts, but builds a level of confident competence in practical accomplishment of much vaunted skills. </p>
    <p> This question is dealt with ,directly and indirectly, in the various other pages (such as the main <a href="topics.html">subjects</a>, <a href="faq.html">faq</a> and <a href="testimonial.html">personal experience</a> of past students. </p>

    <p class ="aboutUsText">Hi. My name is Eugene O' Regan and I am nearing completion of the Higher Diploma in Creative Multimedia Programming as of April 2018.</p>
    <p class ="aboutUsText">While I have a long history of computing, I never really got into the design side of things. So, last Summer, I decided to apply and a year later, I'm here. It's been a roller coaster and this website is a guide to anyone who might be interested in participating in the course in the near future.  </p>
    <p class ="aboutUsText">It is intensive, it is difficult but that being said, I would reccomend it on the proviso ... be ready.   </p>
